# Naive_Bayes

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm along with a performance comparison with Sklearn's package of the same model.

The model I built is able to take any number of categorical features in the training and test sets.

Please let me know if you have any comments on the code.
